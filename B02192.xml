            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LBEIT The Solemn Publick Humiliations, hath bene much ſlighted, and gone about in a formall way, by many in this LAND: So that it is not one of the leaſt of our provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that wee haue drawn near to GOD with out mouthes, and kept our hearts far away from Him. For which the LORD hath turned the Wiſdom of the Wyſe, into Follie; and the Strength of the Strong, into Weakneſs. Yet, ſeeing it is a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that hath often proven comfortable vnto vs; Unto which GOD now calleth vs in a ſpeciall way, by a ſingular diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and knowing that all that are acquainted with GOD in the LAND, will make conſcience of it; Wee conceaue it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, the whole LAND bee humbled, FOR THE CAUSES following:</p>
            <p>THE Continued ignorance and profanitie of the Bodie of the Land: And the obſtinacie and incorrigibleneſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; not-with-ſtanding all the payns that GOD hath taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, by His WORD, and by His Works, of Mercie and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to teach vs, in the knowledge of His Name and Way, and to reform vs, from the evill of our wayes.</p>
            <p n="2">II THE Manyfold Provocations of the Kings Houſs; Which we fear are not yet throughly repented of; nor forſaken of him, to this day: Together with the crooked and praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174314:3"/>wayes, that were taken by ſundry of our States-men, for carrying on the Treatie with the King.</p>
            <p n="3">III THE Bringing home with the King a great many Malignants; and endeavouring to keep ſome of them about him, and many of them in the Kingdom yet; not-with-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Publick Reſolutions, to the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="4">IV THE Not purging of the Kings Familie, from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and Profayn men; and conſtituting the ſame of Well-affected and Godly perſons; Al-be-it it hath bene often preſsed vpon the Parliament and Commiſſioners of Eſtates; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and promiſed, to bee performed by them.</p>
            <p n="5">V THE Levying of a moſt Profane and Malignant Gaurd of Horſes, to bee about the King: Who being ſent for, to bee purged ſome two dayes, before the Defeat, were ſuffered to bee, and fight in our Armie.</p>
            <p n="6">VI THE Exceeding great ſlackneſs of many, and averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; vntowardneſs of ſome, in the chieff judicatories of the Kingdom; And in the Armie, in good Motions, and Publick Dueties: Eſpecially, in theſe things that concern the Purging of judicatories &amp; the Armie, from Malignant, and Scandalous perſons: And not filling all Places of Power and Truſt, with men of known integritie, and of Blameleſs and Chriſtian Converſation: Together with greater inclinations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours, to bring &amp; keep in Malignants, to the judicatories, and the Armie; As though the Land could not bee guyded, nor defended, without theſe; And great repyning, and crying out agaynſt all that is done, in the contrarie; And ſtudying to make the ſame vneffectuall.</p>
            <p n="7">VII THE Exceeding great Diffidence of ſome of the chieff Leaders of our Armie; And others amongſt vs: Who thought, That wee could not bee ſaved, but by a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: And who when wee had gotten many thouſands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Would not hazard to act any thing; Not-with-ſtanding that GOD offered ſundry fayr opportunies, and fitted the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174314:3"/>Spritis of the Souldiours, and for the carnall confidence, that was in many of the Armie, vnto the deſpyſing of the Enemie; and promiſed Victorie to themſelues, without eying GOD.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII THE Looſneſs, Inſolencie, and Oppreſſion, of many, in the Armie; And the little, or no care, that was taken by any to preſerue the Corns: By which it hath come to paſs, that very much of the Food of the Poor people of the Land, hath bene needleſsly deſtroyed: And whylſt wee remember this, wee wiſh, that the Profanitie and Oppreſſion of ſundry of our Officers, and Souldiours, in ENGLAND; Whylſt wee were fighting, for the Aſſiſtance of the Parliament of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may not bee forgotten, Becauſe as it was matter of great Stumbling to many in the Land: So is it lyke, That it is one of the CAUSES of the LORDS Indignation, now manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted agaynſt vs, by the hands of theſe men.</p>
            <p n="9">IX OUR Great Unthankfulneſs, for former Mercies, &amp; Delyverances: And, even for many Tokens of the LORDS Favour, and Goodneſs, towards our preſent Armie; whyleſt they were together; and the great Impatience of Spirit, that was to be ſeen in many theſe weeks paſt; which made them to limit the LORD, and complayn; and weary of His Delay, to giue Delyverance.</p>
            <p n="10">X THE Owning and eying of the Kings Quarrell, and Intereſt, by many, without Subordination to Religion, and the Liberties, and Safties, of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="11">XI Next, the Carnal Selfe-ſeeking, and crooked-wayes; of ſundry of our judicatories, and Armie; Who make their places and imployments, rather a matter of Intereſt, Gayn, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to themſelues, than of advancing Religion, &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in the Land.</p>
            <p n="12">XII THE Not putting difference, betwixt thoſe that ſerue GOD, and thoſe that ſerue Him not, in our Services, our Company, and Imployments; But accounting all men alyke, many tymes praeferring thoſe, who haue nothing of GOD in them.</p>

XIII AND Laſtly: The Exceeding Great Neglect, That is in Great Ones, &amp; others; in performing of Dueties, in thier Families; Not-with-ſtanding of our former acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Sinne: As alſo, The Neglect of Dueties, of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Edification, &amp; great Fruitleſsneſs, and Barrenneſs, that is to be ſeen in al ſorts of perſons; together with the folowing of Dueties, with a great deall of mixture, of Carnall Affections, and Fleſhly Wiſdom; Which grieveth the Spirit of GOD; And taketh away much of the LORDS Image, from our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories; As wee would bee humbled for theſe things: So would wee alſo intreat the LORD; That Hee would ſanctifie this ſad Affliction, to His People, That they neither deſpyſe His Chaſtiſments; nor faynt, when they are rebuked of Him: But that they may bear His Indignation patiently; And cleaue ſteadfaſtly, to the TRUETH, &amp; the COVENANT, &amp; the CAUSE of GOD: Without yeelding to the Furie of the Enemie; Or receaving their Errours; or complying either with them on the one Hand; or Malignants on the other Hand: And, That the LORD would powr out His Spirit, vpon His People; That their Spirit may bee rayſed vnto their Duetie: And that they may bee fitted, and furniſhed of GOD, with Wiſdom, and Reſolution, to act agaynſt their Enemies; For the Honour of GOD, and their own Praeſervation: And, That the LORD will not ſuffer them to bee tempted, aboue that they are able to bear: But that Hee would break the Yoak of their Oppreſſours from off their Necks; And giue them Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Delyverance: AMEN.</p>

               <salute>Right Reverend and dear Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WEE perſwade our ſelves, that ere this come to your hands, you are deeply affected with the ſadde report of the Lords diſpleaſure, declared againſt the Land by the Defeat of our Armie, inſtant September 3. And by the woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequences &amp; deſolation which is lyke to enſue therevpon, if the tender Mercies of the Lord do not ſpeedily prevent vs, and move Him, for His Names ſake, to lift up a Standart agaynſt that Enemy, which is now come in as a flood vpon vs, and is prevayling and rageing in our boſoms. And wee doubt not, but you are ſeriouſlie bethinking your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your duety, and what the Lord is calling you to as the watchmen of His people in ſo dark a tyme. Wee beleeve you haue gotten the Letters ſent to you from ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commiſſion, and other Miniſters who had beene with the Armie bearing their advyce for keeping of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn publique Humilation with your ſeverall flocks, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the CAUSES which were ſent you. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion being now mett, thought good to wryte vnto you, and requyre you in the Lord, as wee do alſo confidently expect of you, that you will be carefull and diligent, to make your people ſenſible of the Lords Hand, that they do not diſpyſe &amp; ſlight ſo great a wrath; ſo to ſtir up, &amp; encowrage them to she dueties, which this tyme and the Lords diſpenſation calleth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174314:6"/>for at their hand; that men bee not found now with their hands vpon their loyns, as women in travail, fainting under the chaſtiſing and rebukes of the Lord: for though it bee the day of Iacobs trouble, hee ſhall bee ſaved out of it, for we are not to doubt, but if wee ſhall return and ſeeke the Lord with all our heart, after all this that is come vpon us, that there is hope in Iſrael, concerning His work and people which are in the duſt for the tyme. In a ſpeciall way, wee do recommend to you, that you do carefully and inſtantly warne your people, agaynſt the ſnares, which they for their tryall may meete with, to draw them to complyance with the preſent Enemy, their errors and way: and that they patiently wayte on the Lord, vntill the indignation paſsover, and not feare their feare, neyther be diſmayed, but would ſanctifie the Lord God in their hearts, that He may be their feare and their dread, ſo that they do not for their ſafety &amp; preſervation choyſe the courſes of fleſh and blood, tending eyther to complyance with Sectaries on the one hand, or Malignants on the other. But that the work of God may be carryed on, and His people may, follow &amp; adhere vnto it in their ſtations &amp; places according to the Covenants &amp; former grounds, &amp; principles. We conceive, that theſe who feare the Lord and make conſcience of duety, &amp; deſyr to be faithful, wil be ſo far from ſlacking their hands in their duety, &amp; in a ſtraight way of perſueance therof for any thing chat hath befalle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now, that they wil rather look vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as called &amp; obliedged to their duetyes, in a more ſpeciall way of ſtrictneſs and watchfullneſs than formerly, and that the preſent difficulties and dangers of the tyme, be not abuſed for flattering of men in any way, that may tend to turning aſide to crooked courſes. And becauſe the Lord is trying vs, how far we wil follow our duety, in the fayth of His ſtrength, in a weak &amp; low condition; &amp; there being ſom endevors at this tyme for making vp the Army, We expect that you will not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in your ſtations, according to your power, for furthering of the levies appoynted by the Committy of Eſtates, &amp; for the ſpeedie returning of ſuch Officers &amp; Souldiers, who are come home, ſince the Armie was broken, alſo ſuch of your own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174314:6"/>who were appoynted to wayte vpon Regiments of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; are now at home, your ſelves would appoint to repair with all diligence to Sterling, where the Randivouſs is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: for there is of every Regiment a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber remaineing, and are together here, and about, without Miniſters, though this be a time wherein they have moſt neede of them.

            <head>A ſhort Declaration and Warning, to all the Congregations of the Kirk of Scotland; From the Commiſſ. of the Generall Aſſemblie.</head>
            <p>ALBEIT The LORD whoſe judgements are vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; And whoſe wayes paſt fynding out, hath brought the Land very low, vnder the hand of a prevayling Enemie: Yet muſt not wee bee ſilent; Nor forbear to declare the Mynd of GOD; Nor others refuſe to hearken therevnto. It were ſuperflous, to giue anſwer to the many Calumnies and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that are blazed abroad: For, albeit in every thing, wee can not juſtfie the Conduct of the Armie: Yet wee hold it our Duetie, to deſyre every one not to belieue groundleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: But rather to Eye the LORD, and to look up to the Hand that ſmyteth them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AND therefore, in the firſt place, wee exhort &amp; warne all the Inhabitants of the Land, to ſearch out their iniquities, &amp; to bee deeplie humbled before the Lord; that Hee may turn away His Wrath from us: The Lord hath wounded, and chaſtiſed us ſore, which ſayeth, that our iniquities are many, and that our ſinnes are increaſed: It concerneth the King to mourne for all theſe grievous Provocations of his Fathers Houſs, &amp; for all His own guiltineſs, &amp; to conſider, that if hee have come in to the Covenant, &amp; joyned Himſelf to the Land, upon politique intereſts, rather for gaining a Crown to himſelf, than to advance Religion, &amp; Righteouſneſs; that it is an iniquity which GOD will not forget, vnleſs it bee ſpeedily repented of. It concerneth alſo our Nobles and Iudges to conſider, whether their cariage in publique matters, be ſtrayght &amp; equal, or rather ſavouring of ſeekeing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, &amp; the things of this world, &amp; how they walk in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174314:7"/>&amp; in their privat converſations: There is in many a great deall of Perverſnes &amp; incorrigibleneſs, in reguard of forſakeing ſome ſinnes, &amp; performing ſome Duetyes, not-wiſh-ſtanding of publique confeſſions, &amp; engagements; and this can not but highly provoke the Lord: And it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Officers of the Armie, eſpecially theſe who are Chief amongſt them, to weygh well what the Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them, &amp; to repent of their Diffidence, &amp; Carnall way of acting, &amp; undervalueing Gods people: And Miniſters haue alſo neede to ſearch themſelves concerning their fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs &amp; diligence, doubtleſs even amongſt theſe is much Negligence &amp; Unfayhfulneſs to bee found, for which GOD is angry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Albeit the Lord hath ſuffered that Armie of Perfidious &amp; Blaſphemous Sectaries to prevayll, yet GOD forbidd that the Land ſhould comply with them, what ever may bee the plauſible &amp; fayr cariage of ſome in their Armie: yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is a Leaven of Error &amp; Hypocriſie amongſt them, which all the Lovers of Trueth &amp; Sincerity, would diſcern &amp; avoyd. As the Lord hath tryed the ſtability &amp; integritie of His People in the Land heeretofore, by the prevayling of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, ſo doth Hee now try them, by the prevayling of Sectaries; and we truſt, that they will think it their duety &amp; commendation, to prove ſtedfaſt agaynſt the one, as well as agaynſt the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither would men be leſs careful &amp; active in oppoſing this Enemy, than in oppoſing of Malignants. Our Religion, lyves, Liberties, &amp; Eſtates are as much in hazard now as ever: Al the Ordinances of Ieſus Chriſt, in this Land, are in danger, and the foundations lyke to be overturned, by theſe men, who are oblieged by the Band of the Covenant, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn all theſe; &amp; it were a great guiltineſs to lye down, &amp; crouch under the burden of the ſtrange impoſitions, that they wil lay upon us, &amp; as men without heart to ſuffer our Land, to be brought in Bondage, &amp; our ſelves to be robbed off all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174314:8"/>theſe things which are moſt precious &amp; dear to us,: If wee ſhould do ſo, the Lord would be angry with us, and our Poſterity, could not but curſs us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wee would not think, that all Danger from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants is now gone; ſeing there are a great many ſuch in the Land; who yet maintain their former Principles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we would with as much watchfulnes &amp; tenderneſs, now as ever, avoyd their ſnares, &amp; beware of complyance, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions with them, &amp; take heede that under a pretence of doing for the Cauſe, &amp; for the Kingdom, they get not Power &amp; Strength into their hands, for advanceing &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their old malignant Deſignes: Douhtleſs our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety is in holding faſt our former Principles, &amp; keeping a Strayght Path, without declyning to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT Concerneth all the Inhabitants of the Land, to beware of murmuring, &amp; complayning agaynſt GOD, His Diſpenſations, &amp; queſtioning the trueth &amp; goodneſs of their Cauſe, or quarrelling with GOD, or blameing, or caſting off the COVENANT, becauſe of any thing hath befallen them; That were a great iniquity not to bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; Let us beare the Indignation of the LORD patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, becauſe we haue ſinned againſt Him, untill Hee plead our Cauſe, &amp; execute Iudgement for us: Hee will bring us foorth to the Light, &amp; we ſhall behold His Righteouſneſs.</p>
